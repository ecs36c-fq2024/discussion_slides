# Homework
* There will be 4 homework.
* You have at least *3 weeks* to work on each.
* You have *unlimited* trails to submit & grade you work on Gradescope.
* We provide interface, you implement the functions.
* Test cases are not provided, you are responsible to test your code.
---

# Tools we use for homework
* Platform: Ubuntu 22.04.
  + On Windows: [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
  + ssh to [CSIF](https://csif.cs.ucdavis.edu/).
  + [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). A [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) will be provided with each homework release.
* C++ version: C++11.
* Compiler: `g++` and `gdb`.
  + You are welcome to use `clang++`, but you have to make sure your code works on Gradescope.
* Editor: any of your choice.
  + I suggest [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) and [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) plugins.

# C++ Review

## Pointers & References

```cpp
void increment(int x) {
  x = x + 1;
}
int main() {
  int x = 0;
  increment(x);
  increment(x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

What is the output?
* 0

---

Using pointers

```cpp
void increment(int *x) {
  *x = *x + 1;
}
int main() {
  int x = 0;
  increment(&x);
  increment(&x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

---

Using reference

```cpp
void increment(int &x) {
  x = x + 1;
}
int main() {
  int x = 0;
  increment(x);
  increment(x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

### What's wrong with the code?

```cpp
struct Student {
  std::string name;
};

Student *create_student(std::string name) {
  Student s{name};
  return &s;
}
```

* [dangling pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer#:~:text=Dangling%20pointers%20and%20wild%20pointers)

---

### How to fix it?

```cpp
struct Student {
  std::string name;
};

Student *create_student(std::string name) {
  Student *s = new Student{name};
  return s;
}
```

## Memory Errors

What are other memory errors other than dangling pointer?
